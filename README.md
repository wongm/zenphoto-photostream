# zenphoto-photostream
This plugin gives Zenphoto something resembling the Flickr "photostream" functionality, displaying all recent images over a series of pages, no matter what album they belong to.

# Example

See the plugin in use at https://zenphoto.wongm.com/page/photostream/

# Installation

1. Copy photostream.php and the /photostream folder into the /plugins directory of your Zenphoto installation.
2. Rename photostream.php.sample-theme to photostream.php and copy it into your current Zenphoto theme folder.
3. Enable the 'photostream' plugin in the Zenphoto backend.
4. Navigate to yourzenphotoaddress.com/?p=photostream and you will now see a Flickr "photostream" of uploaded photos.

Note: you will probably need to edit the photostream.php.sample-theme theme file to match the look and feel of our current Zenphoto theme.
